## What is Advent of Code?  
Advent of Code (AoC) is an advent calendar for programmers, where each day of December you are provided with a new problem to solve with a language of your choice. Each year has a fantastic plot and story line you can follow along with as you solve each days challenge.  

## Who makes Advent of Code?  
Each year Eric Wastl and a small team go about creating an event that is enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts around the globe. You can find out more about it on the AoC Website

## Testing
